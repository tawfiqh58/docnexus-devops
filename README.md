A basic CI/CD pipeline for a web application. The web application is a simple static website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) hosted in a Git repository.  

Goal is to automate the deployment process whenever changes are pushed to the repository. Requirements: Version Control: Create a Git repository (you can use a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) to host the web application code. Continuous Integration (CI): Set up a CI process using a CI/CD tool of your choice (e.g., Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, GitHub Actions). The CI process should do the following: Clone the repository. Build the web application. Run basic tests (e.g., check if HTML/CSS is valid). If the tests pass, create a build artifact.  

Continuous Deployment (CD): Implement a CD process that deploys the web application to a simple web server or cloud storage whenever changes are pushed to the main branch of the repository.  

Monitoring: Implement basic monitoring or logging to track the status of the deployment process.
